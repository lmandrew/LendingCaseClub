## General Information
This case study endeavors to provide practical insight into the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) within a genuine business context. 
Through this case study, we aim to cultivate a fundamental comprehension of risk analytics within the banking and financial sectors, 
illustrating the utilization of data to mitigate the risk associated with lending to customers, thereby safeguarding against potential financial losses.



## Conclusions
- Approximately 15% of loans end in charge offs, indicating a notable proportion compared to those fully paid.
- Notably high correlations exist between 'total_pymnt' and 'total_pymnt_inv', as well as between 'loan_amnt' and 'funded_amnt'.
- Individuals with less than one year of employment exhibit a higher likelihood of defaulting.
- There's a discernible trend of decreasing charge off rates with increasing employment length.
- Borrowers tend to default more frequently when faced with higher interest rates.
- Loan defaults are evident across various loan amounts, suggesting no dependency on loan size.
- Longer loan terms correlate with higher default rates.
- Small business loans exhibit a higher charge off percentage compared to other loan purposes, suggesting caution in lending to small business borrowers.
- The incidence of charge offs increases with higher public bankruptcies, highlighting a potential risk factor in lending decisions.
